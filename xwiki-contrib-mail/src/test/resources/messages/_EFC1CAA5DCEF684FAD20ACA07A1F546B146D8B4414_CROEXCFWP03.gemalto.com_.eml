Several answers:

1) Well, XWiki is an open source project and we're accepting =20
contributions and even committers. So if anyone wants to improve and =20
maintain something just create a jira issue and attach a patch to it.

2) Now that said, it's true that so far the core committers have only =20
been maintaining one skin at a time and skins like dodo and finch are =20
not currently maintained by the committers (only by the contributors).

3) What we'd like to do in the future is to extract common code in =20
these 2 skins (albatross and the new one) and move that into templates =20
in order to make creating new skins very easy and easy to maintain.

4) BTW this new skin is based on Albatross templates so all templates =20
will be maintained de facto. The main different thing is the CSS.

Seen these answers, I think the answer is probably yes but then it'll =20
eventually depend on the committers and the community's help.

Thanks
