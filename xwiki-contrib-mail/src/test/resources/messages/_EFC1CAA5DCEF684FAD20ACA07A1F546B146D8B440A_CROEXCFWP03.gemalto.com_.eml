Hello,

Are you sure that user name as it appears in user admin page (Xwiki.XWikiUs=
ers) is exactly the same as in group admin page ?? (Xwiki.XWikiAdminGroup)

I don't think names with ':' are suitable name.

For instance in my wiki the names are of this form: 'XWiki.jbousque' in gro=
ups users list.
